8️⃣ Magic (Dunder) Methods in Python
🔹 What are Magic (Dunder) Methods?

Magic methods are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores:

__methodname__


They are also called dunder methods (double underscore → dunder).

👉 They allow your objects to behave like built-in types (int, list, string, etc.)

Simple Meaning:

They tell Python how your object should behave in special situations.

Like:

When printing → print(obj)

When adding → obj1 + obj2

When using len() → len(obj)

Important Magic Methods (Very Simple)


✅ What is __str__()?

__str__() is a magic (dunder) method that tells Python:

“When someone prints this object, what text should I show?”

👉 What to show when you print an object

class Student:
    def __str__(self):
        return "I am a student"

s = Student()
print(s)   # I am a student

2️⃣ __repr__()

👉 Technical / developer representation of object

class Student:
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Student() object"

s = Student()
print(s)   # Student() object

| `__str__()`    | `__repr__()`   |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| For users      | For developers |
| Human-friendly | Debug-friendly |
| print(obj)     | repr(obj)      |
| Display        | Technical view |
Important Rule:
If __str__() is missing, Python uses __repr__() as fallback.



3️⃣ __add__()

👉 What happens when you use +

class Number:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.x + other.x

a = Number(10)
b = Number(20)

print(a + b)   # 30

4️⃣ __len__()

👉 What happens when you use len()

class Bag:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.items)

b = Bag([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(len(b))   # 4

🧠 Very Simple Line:

Magic methods make your class objects act like normal Python objects.

🔥 Hard Practice Questions (Magic Methods)

Create a class Library that:

Stores list of books

len(library) → returns number of books

print(library) → shows "Library with X books"

Create a class Money:

Has amount

Using + should add two Money objects

Using str() should show: "₹ <amount>"

Create a class Vector:

Has x and y

+ adds vectors

len() returns magnitude (√(x² + y²))

print() shows (x, y)

9️⃣ Composition & Aggregation (Has-A Relationship)

These are relationships between classes.

👉 One class contains another class
This is called Has-A relationship

Example:

Car has an Engine
Student has a Laptop
House has Rooms

🔹 Composition (Strong Has-A)
Meaning:

Child object cannot exist without parent object.

If parent is destroyed → child is destroyed ❌

Example:
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()   # Engine created inside Car

    def drive(self):
        self.engine.start()
        print("Car is moving")


👉 If Car is deleted → Engine also gone
✅ Strong dependency = Composition

🔹 Aggregation (Weak Has-A)
Meaning:

Child object can exist independently of parent.

If parent is destroyed → child still exists ✅

Example:
class Laptop:
    def work(self):
        print("Laptop working")

class Student:
    def __init__(self, laptop):
        self.laptop = laptop   # external object

    def study(self):
        self.laptop.work()


👉 Laptop exists even if Student is deleted
✅ Weak dependency = Aggregation

🧠 Easy Memory Trick:
Type	Meaning	Dependency
Composition	Strong Has-A	Cannot live alone ❌
Aggregation	Weak Has-A	Can live alone ✅
🔥 Hard Practice Questions (Composition & Aggregation)

Design a system:

Human and Heart

Use composition

Heart should not exist without Human
Implement live() method.

Design a system:

Company and Employee

Use aggregation

Employee should exist even without Company
Implement work() method.

Build a mini project structure:

School

Teacher

Student
Rules:

School has teachers (aggregation)

Student has IDCard (composition)
Implement relationships properly.

🎯 One-Line Exam Definitions:
Magic Methods:

Special methods in Python with double underscores that define object behavior for built-in operations.

Composition:

Strong has-a relationship where child object depends on parent for existence.

Aggregation:

Weak has-a relationship where child object exists independently.
