🔹 7️⃣ Abstraction in Python (Simple Version)
1️⃣ Meaning

Abstraction = hiding unnecessary details and showing only important features.

Focus on what an object does, not how it does it

Makes code clean, safe, and reusable

2️⃣ Abstract Classes

A class that cannot be created directly

Meant to be inherited by child classes

Defines methods that child classes must implement

Use abc module:

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass


ABC → marks the class as abstract

@abstractmethod → method must be implemented by child classes

3️⃣ Abstract Methods

Methods with no body in abstract class

Child classes must override them

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof Woof")

d = Dog()
d.sound()  # Woof Woof

4️⃣ Why Use Abstraction?

Hide complexity

Force child classes to implement methods

Clean and maintainable code

Real-world modeling: e.g., Vehicle with start() and stop()

5️⃣ Real-Life Analogy

Abstract class = Blueprint

Abstract method = Rooms you must build

Concrete class = House built from blueprint

6️⃣ Hard Questions (Same as Before)
Q1: Shape Hierarchy

Abstract class Shape → abstract methods area() and perimeter()

Implement Circle, Rectangle, Triangle

Function to calculate total area and perimeter of a list of shapes

Q2: Employee Payroll System

Abstract class Employee → abstract methods calculate_salary(), get_details()

Implement FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee

Print total payroll

Q3: Bank Account System

Abstract class BankAccount → abstract methods deposit(amount), withdraw(amount)

Implement SavingsAccount (min balance) and CurrentAccount (overdraft)

Function to transfer money

Q4: Shape Drawer with Colors

Abstract class ColoredShape → abstract methods draw() and fill_color(color)

Implement Circle, Square, Triangle

Track count of each shape drawn

Q5: Data Exporter

Abstract class DataExporter → abstract methods read_data(), export_data()

Implement CSVExporter, JSONExporter, ExcelExporter

Function export_all(data, exporters) calls export_data() for all
