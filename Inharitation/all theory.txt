✅ INHERITANCE (OOP in Python)[Pro_3.Py to ]
✅ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance means a child class takes properties and methods from a parent class.

Why we use inheritance?
✅ Code reuse
✅ Easy maintenance
✅ Real-world relationship (Parent → Child)
✅ Supports polymorphism (overriding)

Syntax
class Parent:
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass
1️⃣ Single Inheritance
✅ Meaning
One child class inherits from one parent class

Example
class Father:
    def skills(self):
        print("Father: Driving, Business")

class Son(Father):
    def own_skills(self):
        print("Son: Coding")

s = Son()
s.skills()
s.own_skills()

Output
Father: Driving, Business
Son: Coding

🧠 Questions (Single Inheritance)
⭐ Intermediate
Create class Animal with method eat().
Create class Dog(Animal) with method bark(). Call both methods.(pro_3)

Create class Employee with name, salary.
Create class Developer(Employee) with language. Print all details.(pro_4)

🔥 Hard
Create class Account with balance and method deposit() and withdraw().
Create class SavingsAccount(Account) that adds interest_rate and method add_interest().(pro_5.py)

Create class Vehicle with start() and stop().
Create class Car(Vehicle) and override start() to print "Car starts with key".(pro_6.py)

2️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance
✅ Meaning
Inheritance chain like:
Grandparent → Parent → Child

Example
class GrandFather:
    def land(self):
        print("Grandfather: Land")

class Father(GrandFather):
    def house(self):
        print("Father: House")

class Son(Father):
    def bike(self):
        print("Son: Bike")

s = Son()
s.land()
s.house()
s.bike()
🧠 Questions (Multilevel Inheritance)
⭐ Intermediate
Create Person -> Student -> CollegeStudent
Add one method in each class and call all from CollegeStudent.(pro_7.py)

Create Company -> Manager -> TeamLead
Add attributes in each and print all.(pro_8.py)

🔥 Hard
Create Device -> Mobile -> Smartphone

Device has power_on()

Mobile has call()

Smartphone has internet()
Also override power_on() in Smartphone.(pro_9.py)

Create A -> B -> C
Each class has constructor printing its class name.
Use super() to call constructors properly.(pro_10.py)

3️⃣ Multiple Inheritance
✅ Meaning
One child class inherits from multiple parent classes

Example
class Father:
    def father_quality(self):
        print("Father: Discipline")

class Mother:
    def mother_quality(self):
        print("Mother: Caring")

class Child(Father, Mother):
    def child_quality(self):
        print("Child: Smart")

c = Child()
c.father_quality()
c.mother_quality()
c.child_quality()
✅ Python supports multiple inheritance.

⚠️ Important: MRO (Method Resolution Order)
If both parents have same method name, Python follows MRO.

class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B:
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A, B):
    pass

obj = C()
obj.show()
print(C.mro())
It will call A first because A is first in (A, B).

🧠 Questions (Multiple Inheritance)
⭐ Intermediate
Create class Camera with method take_photo()
Create class Phone with method call()
Create class SmartPhone(Camera, Phone) and call both.(pro_11.py)

Create Teacher and Singer classes.
Child class Person(Teacher, Singer) should use both methods.(pro_12.py)

🔥 Hard
Create class A and B both have method display().
Child class C(A, B) calls display() and print MRO.
Then change order C(B, A) and check output difference.(pro_13.py)

Create LoginSystem and PaymentSystem both have start() method.
Create EcommerceApp(LoginSystem, PaymentSystem)
Solve method conflict using:

super()

Explicit class calling (LoginSystem.start(self))(pro_14.py)

4️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance
✅ Meaning
One parent class, many child classes

Like:
Parent → Child1
Parent → Child2
Parent → Child3

Example
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animals make sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Cat meows")

d = Dog()
c = Cat()

d.sound()
c.sound()
🧠 Questions (Hierarchical Inheritance)
⭐ Intermediate
Create Shape class with method area()
Create Circle(Shape) and Rectangle(Shape) with their own area formulas.(pro_16.py)

Create BankAccount class
Create SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount as child classes.(same as dont need to do)

🔥 Hard
Create parent class Notification with method send()
Create child classes:

EmailNotification

SMSNotification

WhatsAppNotification
Override send() in each.(pro_17.py)

Create parent Employee and child classes Developer, Designer, Tester
Each should override method work().

5️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance
✅ Meaning
Hybrid inheritance = mix of two or more inheritance types
Example: combination of multiple + multilevel etc.(pro_18.py)

⚠️ Python supports hybrid inheritance.

Example (Hybrid: Multiple + Multilevel)
class A:
    def showA(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def showB(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def showC(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):
    def showD(self):
        print("D")

obj = D()
obj.showA()
obj.showB()
obj.showC()
obj.showD()
🧠 Questions (Hybrid Inheritance)
⭐ Intermediate
Create Person class
Create Student(Person) and Employee(Person)
Create WorkingStudent(Student, Employee)
Print all details.(same as above)

Create Machine → Vehicle(Machine)
Create Car(Vehicle) and Electric(Car, Machine) hybrid.(same as above)

🔥 Hard
Create a hybrid system and print MRO.
Example classes: A, B(A), C(A), D(B, C)
Now add method with same name in B and C and observe output.

Make constructors in all classes and ensure all constructors run properly using super().(same like just above)

6️⃣ Method Overriding
✅ Meaning
When child class changes parent method implementation (same name, same parameters).

Example
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent method")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("Child method")

c = Child()
c.show()
Output
Child method
✅ Child method overrides parent method.

🧠 Questions (Overriding)
⭐ Intermediate
Create Vehicle class with start()
Create Bike(Vehicle) override start().

Create Teacher class with method teach()
Create MathTeacher(Teacher) override teach().

🔥 Hard
Create class Employee with method calculate_salary()
Create child Intern(Employee) where salary is fixed low
Create child Manager(Employee) where salary includes bonus
Override method in both.

Create parent method display_info()
Child should call parent version also using super() and then add extra info.

7️⃣ super() Function
✅ Meaning
super() is used to call parent class methods or constructors inside child class.

Why super() is useful?
✅ Avoid writing parent class name directly
✅ Helps in multiple inheritance (MRO)
✅ Calls parent constructor properly

✅ super() with method
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent show")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        super().show()
        print("Child show")

c = Child()
c.show()
Output
Parent show
Child show
✅ super() with constructor
class Parent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.age = age

c = Child("Rajan", 19)
print(c.name, c.age)
🧠 Questions (super)
⭐ Intermediate
Create class A with method hello()
Create class B(A) override hello and use super().

Create Person(name) and Student(name, roll)
Use super() to set name.

🔥 Hard
Create multiple inheritance classes and use super() properly:

A -> B(A)

A -> C(A)

D(B, C)
Make constructors in all and call all using super().

Create class Shape with area()
Child class Rectangle calls parent area using super then modifies output.

✅ Quick Summary Table (Very Important)
Type	Meaning
Single	1 parent → 1 child
Multilevel	Grandparent → Parent → Child
Multiple	Multiple parents → 1 child
Hierarchical	1 parent → many children
Hybrid	Combination of inheritance types
Overriding	Child changes parent method
super()	Calls parent methods/constructor

NOTE:now last four-8 questios are still same as above(pro_8 to 14 ) but little change
